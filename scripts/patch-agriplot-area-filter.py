"""
Relax the /plots/search area filter from `area_hectares > 0.5` to `> 0` so real
smallholder plots (coffee/cocoa parcels well under 0.5 ha) still show on the map.

Run from the sustainit project root (e.g. /var/www/sustainit):
    python3 /var/www/averos.land/scripts/patch-agriplot-area-filter.py
    npm run build && pm2 restart sustainit-live

Idempotent: detects the already-relaxed state and does nothing.
